# Spring Cloud Contract - Workshop

This was a workshop we did for Spring I/0 2018, demonstrating Spring Cloud Contract functionality using 2 microservices
* tapas-eater = consumer
* tapas-app = producer

You can follow the TODO's in the code (master branch) or just checkout the 'solution' branch for a working demo of Spring Cloud Contract. The guide for the exercise is bundled in the repository: 'spring-cloud-contract-exercise.pdf'
